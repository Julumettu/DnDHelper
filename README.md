# DnDHelper
DnDHelper website using Django as backend API and React as frontend

This project was made for me to learn full-stack website development. This should provide a good framework for anyone
wanting to run a DND-campaing with the following features once complete:

- Sending notes to DM that only DM and player can see
- Easily accessible API for searching, updating and pushing new items and creatures to the website
- Permissions for views so there are some views only the DM (essentially admin but not quite) can see and others
that only specific players can see
- Player-character sheets with easily updatable fields

All database and backend logic will be handeled by django. React will be used to make this data visually more appealing.
